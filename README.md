# Map.json Generator
This repo contains code to generate `map.json` for displaying the mode map in [Techmino Hub](https://techmino-hub.github.io/).

## Dependencies
1. [`lua`](https://www.lua.org/download.html)
2. `ts-node`, installed using `npm i -g ts-node`
3. node type definitions, installed using `npm i --save-dev @types/node`
4. node fetch type definitions, installed using `npm i --save-dev @types/node-fetch`
5. node fetch module, installed using `npm i node-fetch`

## Running
After installing dependencies, run `main.ts` by doing `ts-node main.ts`

## About Extra Modes
The `/data/extra_modes.json` file exists because some of the modes in-game are not actually in the mode map.  
Reasons can include:
- It's a hidden mode (no I'm not spoiling how to access it; go find out yourself ðŸ˜‰)
- It's a mode which no longer exists in the latest version of the game
- It's an old version of some modes with different/unique mechanics

Note that the Y coordinate aren't the same as the Y coordinates on the normal map; they are shifted down 10 units under the bottommost "non-extra" mode.

## Output Format
The output will be generated in `./modes.json` by default. The output will be a minified JSON containing an object.  
Here's a non-minified JSON for reference:
```json
{
    "sprint_10l": {
        "name": "sprint_10l",
        "shape": 1,
        "unlock": ["sprint_20l"],
        "size": 40,
        "x": 0,
        "y": 0,
        "icon": "sprint1"
    },
    "sprint_20l": {
        "name": "sprint_20l",
        "shape": 1,
        "unlock": [],
        "size": 50,
        "x": -200,
        "y": 200,
        "icon": "sprint1"
    }
}
```
